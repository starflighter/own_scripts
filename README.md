# own_scripts
my script collection. No guarantee that this will work ;-).

Not all of them are made by myself, I hope that all other authors in the scripts are named..
I use this as cache of the scripts and because github is not blocked in the most companies.
You can use this if you want, but don't earn money with this little bit of code!
